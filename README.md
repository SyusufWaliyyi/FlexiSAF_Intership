Tyhe program must Define the game board, Check if a player has won, Check if the game is a tie, Main game loop, Call the main game loop,                                                                                                                                                                                                              2. Using Matplotlib, complete the following tasks using the data contained here: https://pynative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/company_sales_data.csv:                                                        a. Exercise 1: Read Total profit of all months and show it using a line plot.                                                                         b. Exercise 2: Read data for Bathing soap and facewash of all months and display it using the Subplot.


Week_4
"Analyze a small, publicly available dataset using Python's NumPy or Pandas libraries.                                                                                                
1. Explore the data:

Print the first few rows using data.head().
Check the data types of each column using data.info().
Get summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) using data.describe().

2. Calculate basic statistics:

Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for each numerical feature.
Calculate the correlation between different features using data.corr().
